"""
DCP (Device Control Protocol) Placeholder.

This file is a placeholder for future implementation of the DCP protocol
for newer Onkyo/Integra/Pioneer receivers.

Currently, this integration only supports eISCP.

# Future TODO: Implement DCP client class here.
# This would likely involve:
# 1. Discovery mechanism (SSDP/MDNS) specific to DCP
# 2. TCP/UDP connection handling
# 3. Message parsing and serialization
# 4. Integration with the main OnkyoConnectionManager or a new manager
